# DLT.GREEN Decentralized collaborator voting: Intro

Two weeks ago we all signed the contribution rules through a review.  
Points 8, 9 and 10 are particularly important to pay attention to.

8: A collaborator can be deleted with 75% approval via a vote  
9: These rules must be reviewed by every collaborator  
10: Failure to comply with the rules will result in immediate exclusion without prior notice

Unfortunately, we did not receive a review of our collabrator Antonio Nardella until now. We tried to reach him several times on Twitter, discord and github. An attempt to get feedback via the IF was also unsuccessful. So we don't know what happened, We hope that he is doing well and wish him all the best in his future endeavors, but as the rules say we have to remove him as a collabrator from our git repo. For this there will be a vote in our github repo where every collaborator has to agree (=no changing request) and the reviews must reach 75%. I will prepare this PR on github, so the first contributing vote will start tomorrow evening. Some of you will know that this is not easy for us personally, but rules must be followed by everyone, also by me.
